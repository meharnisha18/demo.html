        The programming language Java was named in 1995 by its creator, James Gosling, and the Green Team at Sun Microsystems, to replace the original name, "Oak". The team sought a unique, dynamic, and memorable name after "Oak" was found to be trademarked.
        While debating options like Silk, DNA, and Ruby, the team settled on Java, inspired by the coffee they drank, which was named after the Indonesian island of Java. The name was chosen because it was fun, easy to say, and represented the energetic
        spirit of the new technology.
